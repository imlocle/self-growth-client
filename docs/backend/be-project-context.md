# PROJECT CONTEXT — Self-Growth

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: February 16, 2026  
**Status**: Production Ready

This document defines **how to think** about the Self-Growth project.
It is not implementation detail — it is design intent and architectural philosophy.

---

## 1. Vision

Self-Growth is a **human-first personal development system** designed for:

- Individuals tracking personal growth and habits
- Families managing shared goals and responsibilities
- Caregivers supporting dependents (children, elderly, disabled)
- Shared devices with multi-user support
- Long-term habit and behavior tracking with analytics
- Privacy-first data ownership

The app should work just as well for:

- A single person tracking habits and todos
- A parent tracking a child's development milestones
- Someone caring for an elderly parent's medication and appointments
- A household managing shared responsibilities and chores
- A therapist tracking client progress (future use case)

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

### 1. Explicit Ownership

Every piece of data belongs to:
**User → Household → Subject → Entity**

Nothing is global. Nothing is implicit.

- Users authenticate via Cognito
- Households contain members and subjects
- Subjects are tracked individuals (self, child, dependent)
- Entities (ToDo, Habit, HabitEvent, BlogPost) belong to subjects

---

### 2. Separation of Identity vs Profile

- **Cognito User** = authentication (AWS managed)
- **UserProfile** = application identity (app managed)

This allows:

- Multiple profiles per user (future)
- Shared devices
- Caregiver permissions (future)
- Separation of auth concerns from app data

---

### 3. Service Layer Is Law

Authorization and business logic live in services, never in controllers or repositories.

- **Controllers**: Parse and validate input
- **Services**: Enforce authorization and business rules
- **Repositories**: Data access only

This prevents security bypasses and ensures consistent enforcement.

---

### 4. Shared RequestContext Pattern

RequestContext is the single source of truth for all request data:

- Created once in Handler
- Shared with Controller
- Lazy-loaded and cached
- Eliminates duplicate extraction logic
- Provides full context for error logging

---

### 5. Single Validation Point

Input validation happens in Controllers only:

- Controllers validate and normalize input
- Services receive pre-validated data
- No duplicate validation logic
- Clear separation of concerns

---

### 6. Time Is a First-Class Concept

Habits are not static — they repeat, streak, reset, and fail.

Events exist so the system can answer:

- "How often did this happen?"
- "How consistent was the behavior?"
- "What changed over time?"

Period keys (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-Www, YYYY-MM) ensure deterministic tracking.

---

### 7. Deterministic Data

If two requests represent the same real-world action:

- They should map to the same DynamoDB key
- The system should be idempotent by default
- Conditional writes prevent duplicates

Example: Creating a habit event for "today" twice should update the same record.

---

## 3. Mental Model

### User

An authenticated identity (Cognito sub). Can be a member of multiple households.

### UserProfile

Application-level identity with username, email, name, phone number. Does NOT contain `household_id` or `subject_id` because users can be members of multiple households.

### Household

A shared container representing:

- Family
- Couple
- Care group
- Shared account

### HouseholdMember

Junction entity linking Users to Households with roles (owner, admin, member). Represents authenticated users who can access the household.

### HouseholdSubject (Subject)

An individual being tracked within a household (junction entity):

- You (type: `self`)
- Your child (type: `child`)
- Your parent (type: `adult`)
- A pet (type: `pet`)

Links Subject to Household with `household_id`, `created_by_user_id`, `type`, `display_name`, `dob`.

- `created_by_user_id`: User who created this subject (ownership tracking)
- `display_name`: Name shown in UI (e.g., "Emma", "Dad", "Fluffy")
- `dob`: Date of birth for age-based features and milestones

### ToDo

A task scoped to a subject with status, difficulty, checklist, due date.

### Habit

The _definition_ of intent:

- Type: build or quit
- Counter: daily, weekly, monthly
- Difficulty: trivial, easy, medium, hard

### HabitEvent

The _proof_ of action:

- One event per habit per period
- Status: done, skipped, failed
- Deterministic period keys

### BlogPost

Personal notes and reflections scoped to a subject with visibility controls.

---

## 4. Security Philosophy

- **Assume path parameters can be guessed**
- **Assume clients are hostile**
- **Never trust frontend-provided IDs**
- **Always validate ownership via membership tables**

Every service method validates:

1. User is a member of the household
2. Subject exists within the household

This prevents path parameter spoofing attacks where a user tries to access another household's data.

---

## 5. API Philosophy

- **REST, not RPC**
- **Path params define scope** (household, subject, entity)
- **Query params define filtering** (status, date range)
- **Body defines intent** (data to create/update)

Example:

```
POST /households/{householdId}/subjects/{subjectId}/habits/{habitId}/events
```

This URL structure enforces the ownership hierarchy and makes authorization explicit.

---

## 6. Why This Architecture

This architecture was chosen to:

- **Scale gradually**: Serverless scales automatically
- **Avoid premature abstraction**: No ORM, no heavy frameworks
- **Keep Lambda cold starts low**: Minimal dependencies, Lambda layers
- **Be understandable without tribal knowledge**: Clear layers, explicit patterns
- **Support multi-tenancy**: Household-scoped data with strong isolation
- **Enable incremental deployment**: Makefile supports single-lambda updates

## 9. For Frontend Developers

### Understanding the Backend

The Self-Growth backend is a **RESTful API** built on AWS serverless architecture:

- **Stateless**: Each request is independent
- **JWT-based auth**: Include access token in Authorization header
- **Hierarchical URLs**: `/households/{id}/subjects/{id}/todos`
- **Standard HTTP methods**: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)
- **JSON payloads**: All requests and responses use JSON

### Key Concepts

**Household**: A shared container (family, care group, etc.)

- Users can be members of multiple households
- Each household has members with roles (owner, admin, member)

**Subject**: An individual being tracked within a household

- Types: self, child, adult, pet
- Each subject has their own todos, habits, and blog posts

**Habit Events**: Time-based tracking

- One event per habit per period (day/week/month)
- Period keys are deterministic (e.g., "2026-02-16" for daily)
- Idempotent by design (same request = same result)

### Onboarding Flow

The frontend onboarding follows this sequence:

1. **WelcomeScreen**: App introduction and inspirational quote
2. **ProfileSetupScreen**: `POST /user-profile` with email, username, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber
3. **HouseholdSetupScreen**: `POST /households` with household name
4. **SubjectSetupScreen**: `POST /households/{id}/subjects` with type (self/child/adult/pet), display_name, dob
5. **Main App**: Store selected householdId and subjectId in local storage

### Integration Checklist

1. **Authentication**:
   - Implement signup → confirm → login flow
   - Store access token and refresh token securely
   - Refresh token before expiration (24 hours)
   - Handle 401 errors by refreshing token

2. **Onboarding**:
   - After login, check if user has profile: `GET /user-profile`
   - If 404, show ProfileSetupScreen
   - After profile created, check if user has households: `GET /households`
   - If empty, show HouseholdSetupScreen
   - After household created, show SubjectSetupScreen
   - Store selected householdId and subjectId in AsyncStorage

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - List user's households: `GET /households`
   - Let user select household (or use last selected from storage)
   - List subjects in household: `GET /households/{id}/subjects`
   - Let user select subject (or use last selected from storage)
   - Fetch todos/habits/blogs for selected subject

4. **Pagination**:
   - Use `limit` query param (default: 20, max: 100)
   - Store `nextToken` from response
   - Pass `nextToken` to fetch next page
   - Show "Load More" button when `nextToken` exists

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Parse error response: `{ error, message, details }`
   - Show user-friendly messages
   - Handle 429 (rate limit) with exponential backoff
   - Handle 403 (unauthorized) by checking household membership

6. **Offline Support** (recommended):
   - Cache data locally (SQLite, Realm, etc.)
   - Sync changes when online
   - Handle conflicts (last-write-wins or user choice)

### API Patterns

**List Resources**:

```http
GET /households/{id}/subjects/{id}/todos?limit=20&status=active
```

**Create Resource**:

```http
POST /households/{id}/subjects/{id}/todos
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{"title": "Buy milk", "difficulty": "easy"}
```

**Update Resource**:

```http
PUT /households/{id}/subjects/{id}/todos/{id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{"status": "completed"}
```

**Delete Resource**:

```http
DELETE /households/{id}/subjects/{id}/todos/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't** hardcode household/subject IDs
✅ **Do** fetch from user's households and let them select

❌ **Don't** assume user has only one household
✅ **Do** support multiple households per user

❌ **Don't** retry failed requests immediately
✅ **Do** implement exponential backoff for retries

❌ **Don't** store passwords or tokens in plain text
✅ **Do** use secure storage (Keychain, Keystore, etc.)

❌ **Don't** trust client-side validation alone
✅ **Do** validate on frontend for UX, backend validates for security

### Testing Your Integration

1. **Sign up a test user**
2. **Confirm email** (check email or use test code)
3. **Login** and store tokens
4. **Create household** (automatically created with profile)
5. **List subjects** (default subject created with profile)
6. **Create todo** for subject
7. **List todos** with pagination
8. **Update todo** status to completed
9. **Create habit** with daily counter
10. **Log habit event** for today
11. **Get habit analytics** to see streak
